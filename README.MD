This is a list of things that should be checked before asking others to be a test audience.

This way testers will report interesting issues, rather than things that should be obvious.

# Slides

For start: is it really useful and necessary to use slides? It is not something mandatory.

## Slide layout

- Text should be large. Very large.
	- Default text size is generally too small, for example in Google Slides
- Images and other materials should be attributed
	- attribution will typically include link, but it should be link to a page with an image, not a direct link to the image file
	- try to find original source
	- credit author, "source: internet" is not a proper way to do that
- Wall of text is nearly always a bad slide.
	- except as an example of a bad slide or where text is used as decoration and is not intended to be readable
	- what is a wall of text? More than six lines? More than 10 lines?
- try to avoid animations, trasnitions etc
	- animations are easily broken on converting to a different formats (pdf)
	- animations make harder to go for example one slide back and later continue
	- instead of appearing bullet points create multiple slides (one with just a title, second with first bullet point and title, third with title and both bullet points)

## Mandatory slides

- Summary
- Link to your website
