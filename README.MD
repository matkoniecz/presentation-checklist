This is a list of things that should be checked before asking others to be a test audience.

This way testers will report interesting issues, rather than things that should be obvious.

# Slides

For start: is it really useful and necessary to use slides? It is not something mandatory.

Even in case of making slides - consider starting from design on paper.

Delivering a speech is what is supposed to happen. Slides are likely to be an useful tool but too often speech degenerates into presenting slides.

## Applies to all slides

- Text should be large. Very large.
	- Default text size is generally too small, for example in Google Slides
- Diagrams, graphs must be readable
	- Complicated images are not readable
- Images and other materials should be attributed
	- attribution will typically include link, but it should be link to a page with an image, not a direct link to the image file
	- try to find original source
	- credit author, "source: internet" is not a proper way to do that
- Wall of text is nearly always a bad slide.
	- except as an example of a bad slide or where text is used as decoration and is not intended to be readable
	- what is a wall of text? More than six lines? More than 10 lines?
		- making presentation is not wririting a book
- try to avoid animations, transitions etc
	- animations are easily broken on converting to a different formats (pdf)
	- animations make harder to go for example one slide back and later continue
	- instead of appearing bullet points create multiple slides (one with just a title, second with first bullet point and title, third with title and both bullet points)
	- logical order
	- single slide should not be used for a long time, breaking it in multiple parts is free
		- what is the generally applicable limit? 20 seconds? 30? 60?
- remove unnecessary slides, text, images, animations
	- remove also all where one is unsure
- for slides with code, math equations or equivalent
	- is it really, really, really necessary?
		- try replacing it with examples, text, diagrams etc
		- try shortening it, dropping unnecessary parts etc.
	- is it text or an image?
		- image of text is wrong and evil
- use monospaced font for code
- use syntax higligting for a code
- for all content, especially text and diagrams
	- is it well contrasting?


## Mandatory slides

- Title slite
	- with, well the title
	- public contact info (email)
- Some funny or at least interesting/impressive slides. Preferrably relevant.
- Catch attention at the beginning before audience will start ignoring you
- Outline/agenda at the beginning (I am still not sure is it really necessary and useful)
- Link to your website
- Link where slides of the presentations are available
- Summary
- Request questions

# Content

- What is the goal of presentation?
	- what is the main idea?
	- is listener able to summarize presentation in one sentece?
		- no longer than 15 words
	- is listener able to recognize the main idea?
	- is listener able to remember main idea?
- Reminder: listeners may know less that presenter
	- try to make presentations that allows people to learn something new rather that make clear that they lack knowledge
		- it applies especially to teachers
- mention benefits as soon as possible

# Presentation

- Test your opening
	- maybe memorize it, word by a word
- Time presentation, remember to leave time for questions
- proper gesticulation
	- if you really have no idea what to do with hands at start of presentation then [imitate Merkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel-Raute)

# Testing presentation

> Practice is the key to a "natural" delivery.
> I have to practice ten times before I hit diminishing returns.
> Keep in mind that you're not trying to memorize a talk. You're rehearsing its presentation. Memorizing a talk would take too much practice.
> The good news is that not all practice has to be in front of a small group.
> Practice a talk alone a lot, and then once or twice with a group. (...)
> Concentrate practice on your opening, since a smooth opening sets up a successful talk. The shower is a great place to practice openings.
>  Consider recording later practice talks, and listen to them for awkward transitions, slides that run too long or inadequate explanations.

Record yourself while testing presentation, and watch recording.

# Technical

- prepare offline backup version of presentation and keep it on USB drive
	- keep also a pdf file version
	- this is paranoid, but it already allowed me to avoid technical difficulties during one of presentations
- host copy of presentation at easy to remmeber location
	- it can be easily redownloaded in case of switching computers

# During presentation

- be extremely early
- test equipment, starting from access to projector
- record your presentation.

# Inspiration sources for this document

- feedback from many wonderful people (I have not asked them whatver they want to be listed in a random git repository, so I will keep it unspecific - but thanks to all of them!)
- [http://matt.might.net/articles/academic-presentation-tips](http://matt.might.net/articles/academic-presentation-tips) - I recommend reading it to everybody and I recommend rereading it to myself
	- final link in that presentation is now rotten. It should point to [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/give-great-research-talk/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/give-great-research-talk/) (I reported this issue with a solution to the author but this blog appears to be dead)
